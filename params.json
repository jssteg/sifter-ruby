You\r\ncan use it to fetch projects, issues, milestones, and people from your Sifter\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    gem install sifter\r\n    \r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nFirst you'll need to generate a Sifter API token. You can do this in your\r\nSifter account by going to \"My Profile\", clicking \"Access Keys\" and filling out\r\nform. Once you've got that, you create an account object like so:\r\n\r\n    hostname = \"example.sifterapp.com\"\r\n    token = \"abc123\"\r\n    account = Sifter::Account.new(hostname, token)\r\n\r\nAll of the functionality in the Sifter API hangs off `Sifter::Account`. You can\r\nfetch projects, issues, and milestones like so:\r\n\r\n    projects = account.projects \r\n    issues = projects.first.issues\r\n    milestones = projects.first.milestones\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    The MIT License\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2011 Next Update\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
